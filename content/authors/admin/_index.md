Ë°åËøúËá™Ëø©,Á¨ÉË°å‰∏çÊÄ†„ÄÇTo travel far and near, to be steadfast in one's actions. Embark on a journey far and wide, steadfast in action. In the voyage of life, let our actions speak volumes, taking tangible steps towards distant horizons. Regardless of our location, let us stay true to our original aspirations, never slackening in our commitment to action, and always maintaining a relentless pursuit of our dreams. Only by doing so can we embrace a more expansive future and allow our lives to radiate a unique brilliance in the course of our journey.
